# Galicerra-SPA

Welcome to Galicerra!

This SPA was a litle project i did over the weekend to experiment with HTML, JS and CSS.

The app is a small compendium featuring NPC characters from a DnD campaign and a map of the area where it is being run.<p>

You can click on the picture of each characther and the page will change, displaying a small text with his/her story! Clicking on the "home" button directs you to the home page where you can select any other characther.

Clicking on the "home" button directs you to the home page where you can select any other characther. The "Map" and "Character" buttons auto scroll the page to show you the Map/Characters! <p>
