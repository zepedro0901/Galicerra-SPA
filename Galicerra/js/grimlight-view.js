             <p></p> After being sent by Godwin The Golden, his father, to destroy the Dragons, Grimlight went to the Scorched lands so we would find and kill the remaining Primordial Dragons.

<p>Although the dragons had destroyed most of the country, their people were set in recovering their cities. He then knew of the pact of non aggression between the people and the dragons. 
The dragons decided to respect the land and their previous owners, and so they pledged to defend their recovering cities from bandits, in return the people of the land would allow them to live a procreate on the reign.

<p>Not believing in the Dragons, Grimlight decided to spy on them so he could expose them to the kingdom. But Grim light was wrong. 
The dragons were true to their promise, and this made Grimlight have a change of heart. 

<p>He negotiated peace between Dragons and all Humanoids, bounding himself with the Primordial Dragon Prince , a new-born dragon, giving him part of his own soul.

<p>He then stayed at the Scorched Lands, for after being apart from the Dragon Prince, both would succumb to terrible pain. The bond made so that they would spend the rest of their lives together.

<p>Now the Nameless Prince lives in the Scorched Lands, side by side with the Dragons he once pledged to destroy.
