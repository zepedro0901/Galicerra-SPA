<p>&nbsp&nbspThey grew up in the Golden Castle, but often sneaked away and had contact with the people of the city. Visiting the city showed Gabriel the poor conditions people lived in, and he regularly brought food and clothes for the needed.

It bothered him that the Family was so concerned with extermination of the dragons while leaving the world to be consumed by Shadows.

&nbsp&nbspWhen they came of age, they stole one of his father's armors and ran.

<p>They explored the world searching for ancient knowledge and artifacts that could be used to restore the Sun.
With the allies they gathered, they formed a group commonly know as the Golden Bastards.

<p>&nbsp&nbspOn one of their dungeons, Gabriel and Gael were trapped inside a debris filled room. In there, Gabriel died and passed his dream of reigniting the sun and ending the age of Darkness to his twin, Gael. When Gael left the dungeon, he assumed Gabriel's identity and continued his role as leader of the Bastards.
