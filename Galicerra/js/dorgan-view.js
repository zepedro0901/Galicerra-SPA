<p>He then he started indulging on human flesh. He ate it so much that he burst and became a being of black mass and pure shadow. 

<p>The once Servants of Light, became the Servants of Shadow with Dorgan as their leader, corrupted by the shadow. Now they corrupt the lands and spread the shadow.

<p>Dorgan is now looking for the biggest amount of soul to consume, leading him to other Gods...
