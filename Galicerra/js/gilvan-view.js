             <p></p> &nbsp&nbspBorn from a distant relative of Godwin The Golden, Gilvan was a more or less normal, if only bigger, than a standard human being.<p>
<p>He felt that being from the royal lineage made him better than the rest and his only wish was to be compared to the Gods Themselves.

<p>Being born with only a vestige of soul from the gods, we has almost powerless. This made him fell small, and was the root of his inferiority complex. Eventually he came to know that every being has a soul, and that the gods only possess more soul than others. That being the only difference, Gilvan started grafting people to himself.

<p>This was the act of conjoining other people's limbs or sometimes their entire body to the body of Gilvan himself.
This was an attempted of joining the souls of the grafted with his own.
This gave him his well deserved grotesque look and reputation.

<p>He now occupies the abandoned Strale Castle. Grafting those foolish enough to venture in and commanding his troops from afar.
