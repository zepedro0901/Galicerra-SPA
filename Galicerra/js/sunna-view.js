             <p></p>At first, the world was a decrepit place, a cold and rocky spot in the universe where there was nothing but darkness. 

<p>In this land resigned the Primordial Dragons. Large magic Beasts, with scales made of the Bedrock of the world. They were four legged and four winged, ever growing and ever living.
After millennia, these dragons fell to a slumber, laying down and merging with the world itself.            
<p></p>
Eventually Sunna came to this dark and decrepit world.
He saw potential, and shared his essence with the land. This world was then filled with light and warmth, and Sunna created the animals and humanoids. What differentiated these two was the presence of a soul. 
This soul was a little bit of Sunna essence, a part of himself, pure energy.
 
<p>While intelligent beings have a Soul Socket, a hollow space they can fill with soul, other beings do not.
<p></p>
Soul is nothing more than energy, divine energy given to all beings by Sunna. 

<p>This energy comes from and it's a part of Sunna Itself. Beings that have a soul have a Soul Socket as well, a hollow space in their spirit that accumulates this energy.

<p>This energy allows beings to utilize magic, allowing them to utilize and manipulate the energy of the world. 
Although Soul normally doesn't alter your physical form, it does enhance naturally your physical capacity. 

<p>Giants amount of soul can change your appearance to match your new found abilities.

<p>A being that loses his soul, transforms into a shadow. A husk of his former being. Shadows sustain on souls.

<p>A Soul cannot be stolen. This means that is impossible for someone to take a soul and add it to their Soul Socket. 

<p>Although, Shadows have the capacity of consuming souls. They quite literally eat the soul of someone, this soul is then stored on their bodies, enhancing their physical prowess and their intelligence.

<p>It is possible for someone to GIVE his Soul. If you are willing, you can transfer your soul to someone, adding it to their Soul Socket. This is the only possible way of enhancing a soul, giving it more energy.

<p>When someone dies, their Soul is momentarily present in the physical world but then moves to the Limbo. 
This is an inaccessible demi plane of Sunna.

<p>Souls in this plane are available for empty Soul Sockets of new-borns. At end of gestation, the Soul Socket develops, and at the moment of birth the new-born receives energy from the limbo forming a Soul.
<p></p>
After a lot of power was burrowed from Sunna, his energy dwindled and the sun faded.
With the fading of the sun, the world was embraced by eternal Darkness.

<p>In this Darkness the Shadows emerged. Twisted beings with no soul that consume the souls of others.

<p>The fading of the sun originated the Moon. The moon is actually Sunna devoid of energy. It still radiates a faint aura, the moonlight.
