             <p></p>His son was corrupted by the shadows. The berserk and corrupt Gaio started a rampage killing his comrades. Incapable of killing his own son, he shared his soul with him trying to diminish the effects of shadow, although the souls he gave only made the shadow stronger!

<p>After the event, the Lightbriner blamed himself a lost his will to fight. He lives in a small hut where he uses his power to manifest SunLight to keep the shadows away and farm to sustain himself.

<p>His power now is only a small portion of what it was, since he gave most of his soul to the corrupted Gaio on hope of saving him, so he can only manifest a small torch of sunlight. <p></p>
After the events that took his son life, Goliah stayed in the forest. 
He has a torch of manifested sunlight that he keeps with himself constantly.

<p>Rarely leaving the house, he uses the torchlight to grow a small garden inside.

<p>Everyday he thinks of going out to the darkness and being slayed by the shadow of Gaio, but until the present day he didn't do it, maybe because he is unwilling of forfeiting his life or because he feels that he deserves even more punishing...
