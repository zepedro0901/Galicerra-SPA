             <p></p> Godwin was the ruler of Loran.
He was known as a humble yet rigorous king, was loved by his people and respected by his family and ministers.

<p>Being devoted to the God Sunna, Godwin had a deep connection with the divinity itself.

<p>When the dragons arised, Godwin called upon Sunna for help. The God shared it's essence with Godwin, giving him soul. 

<p>This made the King's strength compared to one of a God.  He became capable of manipulating lightning, infusing weapons with his power and even throwing bolts of the pure cackling energy.

<p>This power has enough to pierce the Dragons bedrock scales, and so, humanity started fighting back.

<p>Godwin shared this power with the royal Family and some of his ministers. 
His son inherited his lightning, but others develop different habilities. One example was his daughter Gilia, who was blessed with the power to heal and give confort to those who are dying.


<p>After years, the Sun started to dwindle, the days became shorter, the light weaker, until one day the Sun didn't rise at all.
Godwin then understood that Sunna was the sun itself and that they had burrowed too much of his essence .

<p>With the eternal night, shadows started to rise. Vile creatures made of darkness itself. The shadows , being the opposite of Sunna, consume soul, it's essence. Although soul can only be willfully given, shadows have the hability to consume it. Storing it not in soul sockets, but on their own body, growing ever stronger and smarter.

<p> Shadows started rampaging on the kingdom, already damaged by the war against the dragons, so Godwin decided to put an end to it.

<p>He sent his elder son to finish off the Dragons, ending the war once for all. 
He ordered his High Priest to find a way of fighting the shadows and defend the world against them.

<p>He then sacrificed himself, returning the little fraction of Soul that he had left to Sunna.
This sacrifice is known as the Great Dawn.

<p>After Godwin's sacrifice, the sun lit up with a faint orange tint. The days became crepuscular, like an eternal sunset. 
The light was dim, but was enough to repel the shadows who moved underground to protect themselves from the light.

<p>Because of this, underground races like the deep gnomes, the dwarves or the drow were forced to escape to the surface.
